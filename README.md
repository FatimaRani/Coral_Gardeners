_CORAL GARDENERS platform provides data, real &amp; virtual world activities for everyone who wants to be part of preserving Coral Reefs._

## Introduction
A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterised by reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate.  Most coral reefs are built from stony corals, whose polyps cluster in groups. They are sometimes called the rainforests of the sea, they occupy less than 0.1% of the world’s ocean area, yet they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species including fish, worms, crustaceans, etc.
Corals are found all over the world's oceans, from the Aleutian Islands off the coast of Alaska to the warm tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea. Corals are found all over the world's oceans, from the Aleutian Islands off the coast of Alaska to the warm tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea. They are estimated to cover 284,300 km2 (109,800 sq mi), just under 0.1% of the oceans' surface area. 

*You can find a list of where these reefs can be found: [`List of reefs`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reefs)*

## Problem Statment

Coral Reefs have been dying out at a rapid pace over the years. This is due to a wide set of reasons like inadequate awareness among the community, lack of knowledgeable resources for all ages, ineffective climate measures etc. Human activity and a warming planet are rapidly degrading these precious and fragile ecosystems.


## Our Solution 

- Raising awareness & providing a platform “Coral Gardeners” for global partnerships (sponsorships with different companies):
  - **_“Coral Gardeners”_**  platform where people gather information about Coral Reefs and how to preserve them.
  - World Map that provides clear indicators & upcoming events.
  - The community will be informed about the activities that our partners sponsored.  
- To promote and train people of all ages using augmented reality with the help of AI so they can apply real-time techniques effectively. Our platform will be a hub for people, companies and public bodies that sync their efforts related with Coral Reef preservation. Funds, grants, events and other related activities’ data are standardised and stored on our platform. People could find the most updated data on our servers. 

## How We Can Make A Difference
### Coral Reef Restoration
Coral reefs can be restored through the following ways: 
 - coral farming, 
 - creating substrates, 
 - relocation, 
 - invasive algae, 
 - micro-fragmentation and, 
 -fusion.
